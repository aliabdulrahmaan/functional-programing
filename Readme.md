Functional interfaces can represent abstract concepts such as functions, actions or predicates.

Major functional interfaces are
Predicate, 
Consumer, 
Function, 
Supplier,
BinaryOperator, 
UnaryOperator


The Functional Interface **PREDICATE** is defined in the java,util.Function package, the **test** method is t
he abstract method for this functional interface which return boolean based on thr condition.
It improves manageability of code, helps in unit-testing them separately, 
and contain some methods like: isEqual(Object targetRef) : 
Returns a predicate that tests if two arguments are equal according to Objects.
